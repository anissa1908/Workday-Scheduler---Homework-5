# Workday-Scheduler

## Concept
A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add and save important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively. 
When I open the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard businss hours. When I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. When I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event, click the save button for that timeblock and then the text for that event is saved into local storage. When I refresh the page, the saved events persist.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, jQuery, Moment.js, Node.js, Bootstrap, Third-Party API, Local Storage
